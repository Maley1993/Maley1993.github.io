title: My goals as a developer
---

There are two goals that I have set for myself to accomplish over the next year or two as a developer.  

My first goal as a developer is to build a solid foundation throughout the Bloc program I am currently in and carry that into my first job as a web developer. I hope to move into a career that is challenging and will give me the oppurtunity to create something that will be used by a large amount of people. 


My second and biggest goal as a developer is to learn how to develop android applications. The original reason I looked into programming was due to an issue that came up and I was hoping there would be an app to help. After looking on the Google Play store I couldn't find anything to match my needs. I want to make applications that people will use on a daily basis and hopefully one of the apps can make some peoples lifes a little easier.

The first few months have been a little rough as can be expected when learning something new but I will continue to move forward towards accomplishing my goals.
