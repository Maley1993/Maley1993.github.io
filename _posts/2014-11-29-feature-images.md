title: My Experience with Bloc
---

Looking for a program to learn web development was difficult due to the large amount of options but Bloc was the one that took the cake. What caught my attention the most was the fact that it is more of a mentorship than a bootcamp. What better way to learn programming than to have a professional already working in the industry reviewing my work, providing resources that they use on a daily basis in a career as a web developer, and meeting on a weekly basis to discuss and concepts or issues that were difficult to understand. To me this decision was a no brainer.

My first mentor was Bill and he was great. He was only set to be my mentor for the fundamentals section of the program. He was always on time and had a ton of information and resources to share with me. He gave me an optional project to create a static page from a mockup. This project was fun a little frustrating as well but I did learn quite a bit from working on it. Overall, having Bill kickstart things with Bloc really set high hopes for my remaining time with Bloc.

My second mentor at Bloc, which is who I am currently meeting with on a weekly basis, is Alex. He has been a fantastic mentor so far, very understanding, and also flexible with scheduling. Whenever I have had a concept that I don't understand he takes the time to explain it in terms that I understand. This is very helpful due to the fact that five months ago I had no idea what programming was.

So far Bloc has been great and seems to have been the right choice. I hope that by the end of this program I will be ready to start my career as a web developer.
