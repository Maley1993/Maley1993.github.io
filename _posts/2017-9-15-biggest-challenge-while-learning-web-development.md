title: Biggest challenge while learning web development
---

Starting my journey into web development I knew it was not going to be a walk in the park. Prior to enrolling into the Bloc program I read through some blog posts of current web developers and realized that moving into this field would be one of the biggest and toughest decisions of my life. 

In May of this year I began looking into a few options to learn programming and move on from the pharmacy world. I tested the waters first on Codecademy with some basic HTML and CSS. During the time I was working on the sections on Codecademy I decided to fully commit to the decision as coding had really piqued my interest.

I have faced quite a few challenges so far during the past five months that I have been learning programming. Coming from having no experience, learning the terminology and concepts has been one of the major challenges, but the biggest challenge so far has been adjusting to 'thinking like a programmer'. In my current job role as a Pharmacy Technician, all our tasks already hava a set process. If an issue arises there is a procedure to resolve it. When programming, sometimes an issue comes up with no set way to solve it yet or there are multiple different ways. I have slowly been working on changing the way I think through and solve problems and is still one of the bumps in my journey to development.
